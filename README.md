# Quiz-with-JavaScript

## Description

I was tasked to create quiz app that runs in the local browser.
The functionality of this app is:

When the start button is clicked then a timer starts and player is presented with a question.

When player answer a question then player presented with another question.

When player answer a question incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over.

When the game is over then player can save his initials and score.

Here is the screenshot of deployed application:
